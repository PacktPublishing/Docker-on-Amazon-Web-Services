**Build, deploy, and manage your container applications at scale**

## What is this book about?

Over the last few years, Docker has been the gold standard for building and distributing container applications. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leader in public cloud computing, and was the first to offer a managed container platform in the form of the Elastic Container Service (ECS).

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Build, deploy, and operate Docker applications using AWS
* Solve key operational challenges, such as secrets management
* Exploit the powerful capabilities and tight integration of other AWS services
* Design and operate Docker applications running on ECS
* Deploy Docker applications quickly, consistently, and reliably using IaC
